    <strong><p style="font-size: 120%;">Kanguva also known and marketed as Kanguva: A Mighty Valiant Saga is an upcoming Indian Tamil-language fantasy action film directed by Siva and produced by K. E. Gnanavel Raja, V. Vamsi Krishna Reddy and Pramod Uppalapati under the banners of Studio Green and UV Creations. The film stars Suriya in dual role, leading an ensemble cast that includes Bobby Deol and Disha Patani (in their debuts in Tamil cinema), alongside Natarajan Subramaniam, Jagapathi Babu, Yogi Babu, Redin Kingsley, Kovai Sarala, Anandaraj, Ravi Raghavendra, K. S. Ravikumar and B. S. Avinash.
        The project was originally announced in April 2019 under the working title Suriya 39, marking the actor's 39th film as a lead. It had begun pre-production in January 2021. Production was scheduled to start after Suriya had wrapped up Soorarai Pottru (2020). However, it was delayed after Siva got to direct Annaatthe (2021). Filming was later postponed, and eventually the project was shelved. Subsequently, in January 2022, Suriya disclosed that the film was still in progress.</p></strong>
